 AIM: The following notebook is an attempt to train a model in detecting whether a picture fed to the model depicts a clean or a dirty road. 

APPLICATION: The model can be used to detect whether a road is upto a certain cleanliness standards or not in the city. This can help respective municipal corporation to detect whether a image recieved by their server is showing a clean road or a dirty one, further optimizing thier efforts to keep their city clean.

MOTIVATION: I belong to the Indore, the cleanest city in India. Cleanliness motivates me to further enhance the efforts of my city residents as well as our hard working municipal corporation. 

DISCLAIMER: I would like it to be known this is also an attempt to enhance my skills as a Data Scientist in Deep learning and CNN model development. Although the following efforts are largely mine, I would like to point out that I took assistance from a fellow data scientist's previous work on kaggle.
